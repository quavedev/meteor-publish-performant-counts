quave:meteor-publish-performant-counts
================================

A package to help you publish the count of a cursor in near real time.  Interval based counting suitable for very large collections and high user load.


## Counter API


```
new Counter(name, cursor, [updateInterval])
```

`name` is a string used to fetch the count of the count

`cursor` is a collection query that will be counted

`updateInterval` defaults to 10000, which will update the count every 10 seconds.


## Publish from Server


### Publish scoped counts

Counts that are specific to a user or parameter must be declared within the publish function.  This will create 1 counter for each user who subscribes.


```
Meteor.publish('countPublish', function(someValue) {
  return new Counter('countCollection', Collection.find({
  	userId:this.userId,
  	someField:someValue
  }));
});
```



### Server scoped counts


Server scoped counts that are defined outside of publish functions are more efficient that specific counts as it only creates 1 counter per server.


```
var counter = new Counter('countCollection', Collection.find({}));

Meteor.publish('countPublish', function() {
  return counter;
});
```




## Subscribe from client

Subscribe to the publication from client side code.

```
Meteor.subscribe('countPublish');
```

## Blaze Usage

Define a global helper

```
UI.registerHelper("getCount", function(name) {
	if(name)
      return Counter.get(name);
});
```


Call from within a template

```
...
{{getCount 'countCollection'}}
...
```
